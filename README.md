# Octopus Website

This is a project inspired by a combination of coincidences, thanks to a truly random news story. I was trying to find a news story to report on to my Advanced Writing class. Trying to find something the other person presenting on my day wouldn't also talk about was challenging at the time. It was early February, 2025, and most of the news seemed to be quite focused on the US government. I resigned myself to reporting on the tariffs that were taking effect at the time, but decided to keep the radio on before class that morning, just in case something else came up. Luckily, a preview for a radio story later in the day caught my attention. I swear the reporter only said like 3 total sentences: A Spanish seafood company announced plans for the first commercial octopus farm, sparking protests from animal rights activists, scientists say octopus intelligence makes ethical farming impossible, more the story at 11.

I thought, _perfect_. I doubt the other person reporting today will cover this story seeing as it was pure chance that I caught the quick mention of it on the radio. Unfortunately, it was time to leave, and I wouldn't get to hear the full story before needing to report on it. So, I spent my 20 minute trip to class investigating. And as I did, I found myself feeling more and more attached to the topic. Octopus behavior and biology is so unlike anything else we've seen on earth. The saying is thrown around that octopuses are the closest thing we have to alien life, because of how far back their evolution split off from the rest of the 'intelligent' life we've observed. Though it might be human arrogance at play to decide one species more deserving than another of ethical treatment, I strongly believe that there is no commercially viable way to farm octopus in a manner that does not result in undue cruelty.

Which brings us to about two weeks or so after discovering the octopus situation. That same class is deciding on a topic for a multimodal OpEd project (a written opinion piece, along with something like a presentation, children's book, or podcast). My internal CS-geek already knew I wanted to make a website. I had worked on a web application with a group last semester, and was taking Web Development. I was itching to see what I could produce by myself with some new tricks. The option of a website was likely added with the intention of using some sort of website builder, but I had the power (and hopefully the time) to create something from scratch. However, I needed an issue to take a stance on. Environmental topics are very important to me, so I thought I'd choose something in that genre, but nothing specific was coming to mind. There are so many issues around the world, and I have so many opinions on things we could do better, things we've gotten wrong, things we need to address. But only one idea popped into my head, and once I thought of it, I couldn't think about anything else. What about the octopuses?
